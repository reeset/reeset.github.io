Eventually, this is going to be space to host project pages for the C# bagit work.  However, I'll also be mirroring the MarcEdit binaries here for those times (hopefully rare), when my offical site at [reeset.net](http://reeset.net) or the MarcEdit website at [http://marcedit.reeset.net](http://marcedit.reeset.net) are unavailable.
